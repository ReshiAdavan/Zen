My Event-Driven Load Balancer written in C

## Inspiration

- I am looking to expand my knowledge in distributed systems, one project at a time. So far I covered Sentinel, a distributed KV storage which covered consensus algorithms, distributed networking, etc.
- I am looking to create a load balancer and database from scratch and maybe create a large-scale distributed system leveraging these components.

## Topics

- Languages: C
- Concepts

  - Techniques: Multi-threading, HTTP and TCP load-balancing
  - Algorithms: (Weighted) Round-Robin, Hash/Random-Balancing, Least Connections/Traffic,
  - Networks: TLS encryption
  - Other: Logging, Daemon mode
